# Tip-Calculator
Simple Tip Calculator app that calculate the overall bill including the tip value.
There are two inputs: purchase amount, and the tip percentage. There are two outputs: amount of tip out of the total purchase value, and the total amount required.
The code involves simplified JQuery that set values, call back entried from #tip and #total divisions then pass the recult to the #calculator div when the submit button is pressed.
There are a few comments in the file to make it easier for others to understand the code.
The Code implementation can be found on CodePen.io [https://codepen.io/abbbas_alhashimi/pen/poeWmyp]
